          <div id="vision-div">
						<p>Thank you for coming here to find out more about our church and our desire to build "A Place for Grace in the City".<p>
          	<h2>Who are we?</h2>
          	<p>Our church is a community of grace, publicly expressing the gospel of Jesus Christ in word and deed to our city, Toronto. God has blessed our church since our first days in 2005, when we started with four people. We now number almost 500 adults every Sunday, with a growing number of skeptics and nominally-churched people attending our services in order to investigate the gospel. For more information on our church, please click <a href="http://www.gracetoronto.ca">here</a> to visit the main church webpage.<p>
          	<h2>What is our vision?</h2>
						<p>Our vision is to build a movement that would multiply gospel-centered, missional believers in every part of this, and other, great cities. We hope to achieve this in three ways:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Taking God's Grace to the City</li>
							<p>We wish to nurture our congregation to grow in their knowledge and love of Christ. We also wish to reach out to our community. We desire to put down roots and establish a place that not only reflects our values, but extends our compassion and reach into our city; a place for the city to come and hear the gospel and experience the grace of God.</p>
							<li>Taking God's Grace Deep</li>
							<p><span>Catalyzing City Transformation:</span> We desire to equip and train our congregation through a greatly-expanded Faith/Work ministry, Hope Toronto ministry and Grace Centre for Urban Mission, so that we might become culture-changing Christians wherever we work and live.</p>
							<p><span>Deepening our Leadership:</span> We feel called to develop a new generation of leaders to be the foundation of the church in our city for years to come. We are planning a 3-year discipleship curriculum to develop emerging leaders in our church to minister in a post-Christian culture.</p>
							<li>Taking God's Grace Wide</li>
							<p><span>Becoming a Church Planting Centre:</span> We pray and are working towards seeing new churches planted all over Toronto, and beyond, to culture-shaping cities in Canada, and indeed the world. Recently, our denomination (PCA) has asked us to become a "Church Planting Training Centre" for Canada and beyond. Target cities include: Toronto, Montreal, Calgary, Winnipeg, Halifax, Kitchener/Waterloo and other cities of the world.</p>
							<p><span>Raising up Church Leaders and Missionaries:</span> We have an Internship Program today that has trained church leaders to plant three churches in Ontario. We've also coached five other interns for churches in other parts of Canada and Germany. Our goal is to have a full Internship Program that, over the next 10 years, takes 60 people (30 women and 30 men) through an intensive, practical, gospel-centered, internship curriculum that prepares them to take leadership roles in churches all over the world.</p>
						</ol>
						<h2>Why do we need a new building to make this vision a reality?</h2>
						<p>In a nutshell: There is no affordable place in the city to meet our present or future needs.</p>
						<ul>
							<li><span>Space:</span> Achieving our vision requires a home into which we can grow. We are outgrowing our rental facility in that it only seats around 600, while we now number almost 500 adults, almost 100 kids and are growing at 10-20% per year.</li>
							<li><span>Cost:</span> Our facility is expensive. Four hours/week presently costs about $90,000 per year and adding additional events and services at this same space would cost an additional $70-80,000 per year.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2 class="inline">What is the solution?</h2> 383 Jarvis Street, Toronto
						<p>After years of prayer and seeking God for a proper space, we chose to purchase this building for several reasons. Most particularly, 383 Jarvis Street provides us with the following:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><span>A Missional Space for Grace in the City.</span> 383 Jarvis is a great space. As well as meeting our weekly service needs, it can become a center for mission-focused music and art outreaches, concerts and events to bring the experience of God's transforming love to our city.</li>
							<li><span>A Catalyst for Compassion.</span> 383 Jarvis stands at the frontier of where rich and poor collide in our city. It provides us with a strategic place to live out the gospel in word and deed to the spiritually hungry, the physically homeless, the emotionally downtrodden, and the economically broken, of our city.</li>
							<li><span>A Place for learning, renewal and church planting.</span> 383 Jarvis provides the space to fulfill our discipleship and internship training needs. It can also house our Church Planting Centre, training events and conferences of prayer and renewal for our city.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Now that we have bought the building, what does the journey ahead look like?</h2>
						<p>We are so grateful to God for his provision of 383 Jarvis Street. However, the building must be updated before we can move in because: (i) it no longer meets many of the municipal codes; (ii) there is no space for our almost 100 children to meet on Sundays; and (iii) it needs to be refreshed and reconfigured to suit our present needs and meet our future vision.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>What is our timeline for moving in?</li>
							<p>We have put together a team (consisting of members of our congregation and leaders of the church) to establish a road map for buying the building, renovating it and moving us in. This team is working with qualified architects and believe that the construction and permitting timeline look something like this:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><span>Fall 2015:</span> Building purchased & final inspections of building undertaken</li>
								<li><span>Winter 2015/2016:</span> Plans submitted to the city, permits acquired and construction/renovations begin.</li>
								<li><span>2016:</span> Renovations continue while we continue to rent Rosedale school for Sunday mornings. By God's grace we will have an Easter service in the building.</li>
								<li><span>Summer – Fall 2017:</span> We occupy the new space.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>What is our role as a family?</li>
							<p>A Stewardship Process. As believers, this journey we are called to take entails a process of stewardship over our financial resources. God has always called His people, recipients of infinite grace through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, to a life of radical generosity - of their time, their abilities, their resources.</p>
						</ol>
						<h2>How much do we need to raise?</h2>
						<p>We think the journey ahead, of renovating and reconfiguring the building at 383 Jarvis, will require approximately $2 million of donations. However, if we are able to raise more than that amount, there is so much more that we could do in the building or with our mortgage.</p>
						<h2>By when do we need to raise this money?</h2>
						<p>Our fundraising campaign officially kicks off on November 1, 2015 and will conclude on December 31, 2015.</p>
						<p>We hope to raise the required amount by December 31, 2017. We hope that you will prayerfully consider making a financial commitment and donation to this campaign in order to help us to build "A Place for Grace in the City".</p>
